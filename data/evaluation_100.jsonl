I am married to Mr. Wilson Nowak, before he died in 2016. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief\nillness that lasted for only four days.\nBefore his death, both were born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my husband was alive he\ndeposited the sum of ($ 3.5 million) in the bank here in this country in a suspense account.\nCurrently, the fund is still in the bank. Recently, my doctor told me that I have serious sickness which is a cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Knowing my condition\ndecided to donate this fund to church or those who utilize this money the way I would recommend here. I want a church that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, to promote the word of\nGod and the effort that the house of God is maintained.\nThe Bible is for us to understand that blessed is the hand that gives. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband's relatives are not Christians\nand I do not want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid\nof death, so I know where I'm going. I know that I'm going to be in the bosom of man. Exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I hold my peace.\nI do not need telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always and I do not want them to know about this\ndevelopment. In God all things are possible. As soon as I get an answer I will contact the bank here in Abidjan. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My\nhappiness is that I lived a life worthy Christian. Whoever wants to serve the lord must serve him in spirit and in truth. Always praying for their whole lives.\nReply me r more information, in your reply will give me room\nget an answer.\nsourcing another church or person\nthe same purpose. Let me assure you that they will act accordingly as specified. Hope to\nSend me the following information, as per below.\nYour full name ..........\nAddress.........\nAge .............\nPhone number .......\nThe occupation ........\nPhoto ...............\nAnd if i don't hear from you i will look for another person or any organization.

Please visit following page to activate your SUNet ID.\n\nConsequences of Incomplete Activation\n\nStudents will not receive grades for courses attended.\nOnce classes begin, students cannot add, late add, or late drop courses for the current semester.\nStudents are ineligible to register for future semesters.\nIf receiving student loans, the student may enter a repayment status with lender.\nIf receiving student aid, some aid sources may be cancelled and unable to be reinstated at a later date.\nIf receiving an award, the student cannot be hired.\nThe University reserves the right to cancel an incomplete registration for failure to pay tuition and fees.\nWe recognize that you want to succeed and that your time is a very precious commodity and so through Off-Campus Connection, the website for Stanford off-campus students, you'll be able to find out what you need with a minimum of fuss.
